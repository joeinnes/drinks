## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**This application provides an *estimation* of Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) for informational and educational purposes only. It is NOT a substitute for official BAC testing devices (like a breathalyzer) and should NOT be used to determine if it is safe to drive or operate machinery.**

BAC can be affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, individual metabolism, food intake, medication, health conditions, and hydration levels. The calculations used in this app are based on common formulas (e.g., Widmark formula) and may not perfectly reflect your actual BAC.

**Always drink responsibly. Do not rely on this application to make decisions about your ability to drive or engage in any activity that requires sobriety.** If you have concerns about your alcohol consumption, please consult a healthcare professional.
